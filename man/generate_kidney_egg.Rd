\title{Generate a Static Kidney–Egg Network (SBM Special Case)}
\usage{
generate_kidney_egg(n, m, p, q, theta = NULL, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Total number of nodes.}

\item{m}{Integer. Number of “Egg” (chatter) nodes; must satisfy \code{0 <= m <= n}.}

\item{p}{Numeric in \link{0, 1}. Baseline edge probability for Kidney–Kidney and Kidney–Egg edges.}

\item{q}{Numeric in \link{0, 1}. Egg–Egg (block 2–2) edge probability (typically \code{q > p}).}

\item{theta}{Optional numeric vector of length \code{n}. Degree correction parameters for DCSBM.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. Random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A binary \eqn{n \times n} adjacency matrix.
}
\description{
Builds a “Kidney–Egg” graph as a 2-block Stochastic Block Model (SBM),
where block 1 (“Kidney”) is the background and block 2 (“Egg”) is a
dense chatter group. Edges within the Egg (2–2) occur with probability \eqn{q},
while all other pairs (1–1 and 1–2) occur with probability \eqn{p}.
Optionally simulates a degree-corrected SBM (DCSBM) when \code{theta} is supplied.
}
\details{
The model is constructed as a 2-block SBM with membership matrix \eqn{Z} and
block matrix \eqn{B}, where \eqn{B_{11} = p}, \eqn{B_{12} = p}, \eqn{B_{22} = q}.

\examples{
set.seed(1)

# igraph::plot(igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A, mode = "undirected"))

# With degree correction
theta <- runif(n, 0.8, 1.2)
A_dc <- generate_kidney_egg(n, m, p = 0.05, q = 0.25, theta = theta, seed = 123)
