\title{Extract Community Labels from Block Membership Matrix}
\usage{
get_labels_from_Z(Z)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{A binary membership matrix of size \eqn{n \times K}, where
\eqn{n} is the number of nodes and \eqn{K} is the number of communities.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of length \eqn{n} giving the community label
(from 1 to \eqn{K}) for each node.
}
\description{
Converts a binary block membership matrix \eqn{Z} into a vector of community
labels. Each row of \eqn{Z} is assumed to be a one-hot encoding of a node’s
community membership (i.e., exactly one entry per row is equal to 1).
}
\examples{
# Example: 4 nodes, 2 communities
Z <- matrix(c(1,0,
              1,0,
              0,1,
              0,1), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
get_labels_from_Z(Z)
# Returns: c(1, 1, 2, 2)
